<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Salutations! My name is Alejandro Osorio, but for most people, "Alex" is alot easier.
  Since 2016, I've been working as a Certified Medical Assistant. And while the road has been rewarding and I've leanred many useful skills, 
  I'm ready to try my hand at something new, something creative.</p>

  <P>Since I was a kid, I've always loved making things. I still have vivid memories of creating entire worlds and insane scenarios from just a few random legos.
    In my Adult years I've dabbled in graphic design, painting, music and other things. Now, I'm trying my hand coding websites. My hope is to someday be able to create websites
    that really, beautifully express the passions of myself and others. For now, I'm still learning the basics of HTML. I'm also learning to be patient with myself, because the process of learning 
    new skills is never as simple or smooth as I want it to be. So come along for the (sure to be bumpy) ride! Witness the chaos! I want this little portfolio to be not just a project, 
    but a visible display of how my abilities grow over time. Let's see where this goes! (btw, the rest of this is just lorem ipsum for filler)
  </P>
