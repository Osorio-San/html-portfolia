<h2>Alejandro's Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</h3>
<p>A classic filled with catchy songs, lots of humor, and just a touch of horror</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>It's hard to nail down just one marvel movie, but this one has nonstop action and plenty of suspense, which i think is fun</p>
<h3>Big fish</h3>
<p>This is the first movie I ever watched with my older brother that we both really enjoyed. He probably doesn't remember but I always will.</p>
